<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biocoal (Synthetic Coal) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Torrefaction</li><li>Steam Explosion (SE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biocoal, or synthetic coal, is produced from biomass through processes like torrefaction and steam explosion (SE). Torrefaction involves heating biomass in an inert atmosphere, enhancing its energy density and making it more coal-like, suitable for co-firing in power plants. Steam explosion, on the other hand, utilizes high-pressure steam to break down biomass, improving its reactivity and conversion efficiency. Both methods create high-energy, carbon-neutral fuel alternatives that support sustainable energy goals and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.</p></p>
