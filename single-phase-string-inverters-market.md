<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Phase String Inverters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Grid System Type</li><li>Off-Grid System Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single-phase string inverters have two primary market types: on-grid and off-grid systems. On-grid systems connect to the utility grid, allowing generated solar energy to be used immediately, with excess energy fed back into the grid for credits. This setup relies on grid availability and offers cost benefits through shared infrastructure. Conversely, off-grid systems operate independently, utilizing battery storage to ensure a steady power supply when sunlight is unavailable. These systems are ideal for remote areas lacking grid access.</p></p>
