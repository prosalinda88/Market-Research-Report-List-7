<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Interference Screws Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Screws</li><li>Non-absorbable Screws</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The interference screws market is divided into two primary types: absorbable screws and non-absorbable screws. Absorbable screws are designed to gradually dissolve in the body, reducing the need for later removal surgery and minimizing long-term foreign material presence, making them popular in softer tissue applications. Non-absorbable screws, on the other hand, are made from durable materials that provide long-lasting support for bone fixation. Both types are essential in orthopedic and sports medicine for reconstruction and repair of ligaments and tendons.</p></p>
