<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reactive Silencer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resonant Silencer</li><li>Expansion Silencer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The reactive silencer market encompasses two primary types: resonant silencers and expansion silencers. Resonant silencers are designed to attenuate specific sound frequencies through the use of chambers that resonate at targeted frequencies, effectively canceling out unwanted noise. In contrast, expansion silencers work by allowing gas to expand within a larger chamber, reducing pressure and sound levels through a gradual expansion process. Both types play crucial roles in various applications, aiming to minimize noise pollution while maintaining system efficiency.</p></p>
