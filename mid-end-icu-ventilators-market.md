<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mid-end ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilation</li><li>Non-invasive Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mid-end ICU ventilators market is categorized into two primary types: invasive and non-invasive ventilation. Invasive ventilation involves the use of endotracheal tubes or tracheostomy to deliver air directly to the lungs, typically for patients with severe respiratory failure. Non-invasive ventilation, on the other hand, utilizes masks or nasal devices to aid breathing without surgical intervention, making it suitable for patients with less severe conditions. Both types are integral in providing respiratory support in critical care settings.</p></p>
