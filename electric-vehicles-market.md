<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>BEV</li><li>PHEV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Electric Vehicle (EV) market comprises two primary types: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). BEVs operate solely on electric power, using large battery packs for propulsion, resulting in zero tailpipe emissions and longer electric-only ranges. In contrast, PHEVs combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor, allowing them to run on electricity for shorter trips while still having a gasoline engine for extended range. Both types cater to different consumer needs and sustainability goals.</p></p>
